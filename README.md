# Orb Money Detector

Hi, this is a simple Android program for recognizing the value of Indonesian Rupiah banknote (2000-2017). You can see how to use it here : https://youtu.be/Y8_k80hVXKw

I am using ORB method in OpenCV library. It can detect money with 89.17% success rate and average of 5.466 seconds detection time. This does not require any communication with remote server, and all the necessary computations take place on the phone itself.
